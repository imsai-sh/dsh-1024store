 * The site's cross-section navigation, floating clear of the page.
 *
 * The catalog and the rankings are two views of one page and keep their own
 * in-page tabs; what had no home was everything *beside* that page — the
 * community and the API reference. Rather than restructure the layout around a
 * rail, this hovers next to it, so the home page keeps the shape it had.
 *
 * `end` on the home entry matters: without it `/` prefix-matches every route and
 * all three items read as active at once.
