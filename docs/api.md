# API reference (v1)

## Compatibility policy

Every API served by this Worker is backward compatible within its published major version,
including endpoints used only by the site, authenticated tools, internal sync jobs, community
clients and WebSocket consumers. Known third-party use is not a prerequisite for stability.

Existing-version changes may add optional request parameters or response fields that old clients
can ignore. They must not remove or rename fields, change types or nullability, reinterpret values,
change defaults, status/error codes, pagination, ordering, authentication behavior or important
headers. Breaking changes receive a new versioned route while the previous route remains available
through a documented migration and deprecation period.

The executable route inventory, historical schemas and semantic fixtures live in
`apps/web/contracts/` and are enforced by `npm run test:api-contract`.

The public developer API lives on its own host: `https://api.deepseek1024.com/v1/…`
(currently only the search endpoint and `/v1/health`; everything else on that host is 404,
and the bare host redirects to the website docs page). The same Worker serves both hosts —
`api.deepseek1024.com` paths are rewritten onto the internal `/api/v1/…` routes below, so
handler behaviour, quotas, and error codes are identical. `api.deepseek1024.com` is
registered as a second custom domain of the `dsh-store` Worker via `wrangler.jsonc`
`routes` and is provisioned automatically on deploy.

All internal endpoints live under `https://deepseek1024.com/api/v1/`. The Worker and the
maintainer's out-of-band collection jobs are the only D1 writers; every response is served
from a 15-minute KV snapshot of D1, and stale KV is the only degradation mode. Legacy paths (`/api/plugin`,
`/api/plugin/:owner/:name`, `/plugins.json`, `/api/install-stats/:owner/:name`,
`/api/dsh-1024store`, `/api/packages*`, `/api/health`) are removed without compatibility
shims.

## GET /api/v1/plugins

Query parameters: `q` (search), `category`, `sort`.

Returns the catalog listing for external consumers: `packages`, `rankings`, `categories`,
and `meta`. For compatibility, the response structure remains unchanged, but the content is
the installable view: only plugins with a published npm package (the `dsh.bundle`-declaring
latest manifest) are listed, star-ranked by default, and `packages` contains at most the
first 500 entries after filtering and sorting — every listed entry therefore carries a
working npm install command. Browse-only plugins (no npm package) do not appear here; they
remain on the website and, within its own 500-entry install-ranked cap, in
`/api/v1/registry`. `meta.total` reports the number of matching
installable plugins and `meta.catalogTotal` reports the full catalog size, installable or
not.
For npm install methods, this frozen v1 projection emits both the current
`published_package` code and its deprecated `repository_backlink` alias for the same
`spec`/`revision`. Existing consumers may continue matching the old code; new integrations
should use `published_package`. The v2 API and website expose only the current code.

## GET /api/v1/plugins/search

Rate-limited keyword search over the catalog snapshot, mirrored on the website at
[`/docs/api`](https://deepseek1024.com/docs/api). The canonical public URL is
`https://api.deepseek1024.com/v1/plugins/search`; the main-domain path remains as the
internal alias. `q` is required; matches package name, owner, repository, the subdirectory
path segments of monorepo plugin ids, category, and both description languages.

Query parameters: `q` (required, ≤120 chars), `page` (default 1), `limit` (default 20, max
100), `sortBy` (`stars` default, `recent` as an alias of `newest`, or any catalog sort —
the `growth*` sorts additionally exclude plugins without enough recorded star history),
`category` (must be a known category id, otherwise `400 INVALID_CATEGORY`).

Authentication is optional: anonymous callers get 50 requests/day and 10/minute (keyed by
HMAC-hashed client IP; the raw IP is never stored), while requests carrying
`Authorization: Bearer dsh_live_…` from a GitHub-login account get 500/day and 30/minute.
Authenticated quotas are keyed to the **account**, not the individual key, so creating or
rotating keys does not multiply or reset the window.
Every response carries `X-RateLimit-Daily-Limit` / `X-RateLimit-Daily-Remaining`; `429`
responses add `Retry-After`. Unlike the other read endpoints the search response is
`Cache-Control: no-store`.

Error codes (JSON `{"error": "…", "code": "…"}`): `MISSING_QUERY` (400),
`INVALID_CATEGORY` (400), `INVALID_API_KEY` (401), `RATE_LIMITED` (429, minute window —
does not consume daily quota), `DAILY_QUOTA_EXCEEDED` (429), `SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE` (503).

Response: `{"query", "page", "limit", "sortBy", "total", "totalPages", "results": [...]}`
where each result carries the registry projection fields (`id`, `name`, `owner`, `url`,
`category`, `description`, `install`, `added`, `stars`) plus `installCount`, `growth24h`,
and `pushedAt`.

## Account & API-key endpoints

GitHub OAuth is the only sign-in method; the Worker needs the `GITHUB_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` and
`GITHUB_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` secrets (endpoints answer `503` while they are unset at
runtime). **Deploy prerequisite:** both are listed in `wrangler.jsonc` `secrets.required`,
and wrangler 4 refuses to deploy a Worker whose secret store is missing a required secret —
run `wrangler secret put GITHUB_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` / `wrangler secret put
GITHUB_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` once before the first deploy of this feature. Sessions
are 30-day `dsh_session` cookies (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite=Lax) whose SHA-256 hash lives
in D1; API keys are shown once at creation and stored only as hashes.

- `GET /api/v1/auth/github/login?returnTo=/account` — redirects to GitHub authorize with a
  state cookie; `returnTo` accepts same-site absolute paths only.
- `GET /api/v1/auth/github/callback` — validates state, exchanges the code, upserts the
  user by GitHub id, sets the session cookie, redirects to `returnTo` (or
  `/account?login=error` on failure).
- `GET /api/v1/auth/me` — `{"user": {"githubLogin", "githubName", "avatarUrl"}}` or
  `{"user": null}`; always 200, `Cache-Control: no-store`.
- `POST /api/v1/auth/logout` — deletes the session row and clears the cookie.
- `GET /api/v1/api-keys` — lists the caller's active keys (id, name, `keyPrefix`,
  timestamps; never the secret).
- `POST /api/v1/api-keys` — body `{"name"?}`; returns the full key exactly once
  (`dsh_live_` + 40 hex chars). At most 5 active keys per user
  (`400 KEY_LIMIT_REACHED`).
- `DELETE /api/v1/api-keys/:id` — revokes (soft-deletes) the key.

Cookie-authenticated mutations reject mismatched `Origin` headers (`403`); expired
sessions and stale rate counters are purged whenever the daily catalog sync runs.

## GET /api/v1/plugins/:owner/:name[/sub/dir…]

Returns the plugin detail payload for the full plugin id — `owner/name` for a
repository-level plugin, or `owner/name/sub/dir` for a monorepo subpackage (the route
accepts the id's additional path segments; each segment is URI-encoded individually and
matched against the catalog id case-insensitively). The payload is extended with the
plugin's category definition so clients do not hard-code category tables:

```json
"category": { "id": "tools", "order": 50, "label": { "en": "Tools & Capabilities", "zh": "工具与能力" } }
```

Plugins that were only discovered by the topic scan and carry no curated metadata return the
built-in descriptor
`{ "id": "unclassified", "order": 1000, "label": { "en": "Unclassified", "zh": "待分类" } }`.
`category` is `null` only when the stored category id is no longer recognised — that is, the
id is neither in `catalog/categories.json` nor `unclassified` (for example, a category that
was removed from the configuration after plugins referenced it).

## GET /api/v1/registry

Compact registry for the `dsh1024` in-DSH marketplace plugin and external tools. The
response shape is frozen, but the content is narrowed the same way as `/api/v1/plugins`:
`plugins` lists at most 500 entries — the install-ranked head of the catalog (every plugin
with recorded store installs, backfilled by stars), kept in snapshot order. Install rank
rather than star rank because the store client resolves installed plugins against this
list. `count` remains the length of the served `plugins` array — the two must always agree
— and the additive `total` field reports the full catalog size, served entries or not.
Responses from before the cap simply have no `total` field. Clients needing the whole
catalog should page through the website's `/api/v2/plugins` (the catalog repository's
README builder — `scripts/build-readme.mjs` in imsai-sh/awesome-deepseek-harness-plugins —
does exactly that).

```json
{
  "name": "dsh-1024store-catalog",
  "updated": "<ISO 8601>",
  "count": 500,
  "total": 9223,
  "categories": [{ "id": "ui", "order": 10, "label": { "en": "UI Enhancements", "zh": "UI 增强" } }],
  "plugins": [{
    "id": "owner/repository",
    "name": "repository",
    "owner": "owner",
    "url": "https://github.com/owner/repository",
    "category": "tools",
    "description": { "en": "…", "zh": "…" },
    "install": "dsh plugin --profile web add github:owner/repository",
    "target": "github:owner/repository",
    "allowBuild": null,
    "added": "2026-08-15",
    "stars": 12
  }, {
    "id": "owner/repository/packages/foo",
    "name": "foo",
    "owner": "owner",
    "url": "https://github.com/owner/repository",
    "category": "tools",
    "description": { "en": "…", "zh": "…" },
    "install": "dsh plugin --profile web add github:owner/repository#path:packages/foo",
    "target": "github:owner/repository#path:packages/foo",
    "allowBuild": null,
    "added": "2026-08-16",
    "stars": 12
  }]
}
```

`stars` is `null` when unknown. A monorepo subpackage plugin's `id` carries the in-repo
path, its `url` stays the repository-root URL, and its `name` conventionally is the last id
segment; repository-level GitHub metrics such as `stars` are shared by all plugins of the
same repository. The registry is projected from the same KV snapshot as the other read
endpoints. The `install` field carries the official DeepSeek Harness CLI command on record:
the npm package command when the plugin has a published package declaring `dsh.bundle`,
otherwise the GitHub source command as a historical record. Only the npm form is offered as
an install method — the store and the website no longer offer source installs, so a plugin
without a published npm package is browse-only. `allowBuild` is permanently `null`: the
value used to quote a third-party package name, and one unvalidatable name invalidated the
whole registry for every client (issue #159). The key itself stays for frozen-shape
compatibility. The website derives the tracked wrapper command at the presentation layer and
never stores it here; that command is the same official command under a different name
(`dsh1024 plugin --profile web add <spec>`, after a one-off `npm install -g dsh1024`).
`target` is the separately validated structured value consumed by the in-DSH installer; it
never executes the display command as shell text, and current store clients install only
npm targets. Older registry clients that do not understand these fields continue to derive
the GitHub fallback from `id` + `url`.

## POST /api/v1/install-events

Anonymous install-event ingestion for the wrapper CLI (`dsh1024 plugin ...`,
`sourceChannel: "dsh-1024store-cli"`) and the in-DSH marketplace plugin
(`sourceChannel: "dsh-1024store-plugin"`). Both ship in the `dsh1024` npm package; the
`sourceChannel` values are stable historical identifiers.

- The event schema (19 fields) is unchanged; see
  [install analytics](install-analytics.md) for field semantics and
  `apps/web/worker/lib/install-metrics.ts` for the authoritative validation code.
- There is **no catalog-membership gate**: a well-formed event is recorded even when the
  plugin is not in the published catalog.
- Retained protections: strict field validation, `Content-Type: application/json`, 8 KB body
  limit, per-client rate limiting, HMAC anonymization of the client ID, and event-ID
  idempotency.

## GET /api/v1/self/install-stats

Aggregate install metrics for the catalog's own marketplace plugin (plugin id
`imsai-sh/awesome-deepseek-harness-plugins`), rendered by the website's self-install
banner. Returns the same `InstallMetrics` shape that is merged into the plugin detail
payload (`installCount`, `installerCount`, `firstInstallCount`, `reinstallCount`,
`updateCount`, `removeCount`, `failureCount`, `installs24h`, `installs7d`,
`installs30d`, `latestInstallAt`), with the standard read-route `Cache-Control`
header. All-zero metrics are returned when the analytics database is unavailable; the
endpoint never exposes client hashes or raw events.

## GET /api/v1/self/update

Small update manifest for the in-DSH `dsh1024` shell. It is projected from the
same cached catalog snapshot as the registry, using the verified npm install
method for the catalog's own plugin entry:

```json
{
  "package": "dsh1024",
  "version": "0.4.1",
  "releaseUrl": "https://deepseek1024.com/plugins/imsai-sh/awesome-deepseek-harness-plugins/packages/dsh1024",
  "checkedAt": "<ISO 8601>"
}
```

The endpoint returns `503` with `Cache-Control: no-store` when no strict semver
can be obtained. The local shell falls back to the public npm manifest and then
the repository package manifest, so an unavailable site API does not disable
its recovery UI. This endpoint only reports a version; the local backend owns
the fixed self-update package name and executes the official DSH CLI.

## POST /api/v1/catalog/sync

Full-catalog reconciliation from GitHub CI — one of exactly two catalog write paths (the
other is the maintainer's out-of-band collection pipeline).

Authentication: `Authorization: Bearer <CATALOG_SYNC_TOKEN>` where the token is a Cloudflare
Worker secret of at least 32 bytes. The endpoint is not a public submission API: anonymous and
incorrectly authenticated callers cannot create or update catalog entries. Every accepted
repository URL must be the canonical `https://github.com/<owner>/<repository>` URL matching the
first two segments of the entry ID; any remaining id segments are the plugin's in-repo path,
and entries are unique per full id, so one repository may appear in several entries. Responses:

- `503` when the secret is missing or too short on the Worker;
- `401` when the token does not match (constant-time comparison);
- `200 {"ok": true, "total": N, "removedSources": M}` on success.

Request body (produced by the catalog repository's `scripts/sync-catalog.mjs` in
imsai-sh/awesome-deepseek-harness-plugins from its `catalog/plugins/*.json`, with the
`$schema` field stripped):

```json
{
  "source": "github_ci",
  "entries": [{
    "id": "owner/repository",
    "name": "repository",
    "repository": "https://github.com/owner/repository",
    "category": "tools",
    "description": { "en": "…", "zh": "…" },
    "added": "2026-08-15"
  }, {
    "id": "owner/repository/packages/foo",
    "name": "foo",
    "repository": "https://github.com/owner/repository",
    "category": "tools",
    "description": { "en": "…", "zh": "…" },
    "added": "2026-08-16"
  }]
}
```

Behavior: upserts `catalog_repositories`, their `github_pr` source rows, and curated
metadata; entries absent from the body lose their `github_pr` source and metadata while the
repository row itself is preserved (no data loss). The call is idempotent through the upserts
themselves — there is no revision gate — and finishes by refreshing the KV snapshot.

## GET /api/v1/health

Returns exactly `{"status":"ok"}`. No scan or database internals are exposed.

## Page redirects

`/` serves the rankings page without changing the browser URL. `/plugins*` is the canonical catalog path; singular `/plugin*` and legacy `/packages*` paths return `301` to the matching `/plugins*` page.
